What is the value of SQLAlchemy?
The benefit of using SQLAlchemy is that it is a python abstraction that helps makes us communicate with databases easier. With it being database agnostic, meaning the commands we use can work on a variety of places from PostgreSQl to MySQL.

What is a model?

A model in a database essentially handles the data logic.

What is a view?

A view essentially displays all the information from the model to the user.
